    "Min-max scaling is a data preprocessing technique that transforms the values of each feature in a dataset to a common scale, typically between 0 and 1. \n",

    "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that is used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. \n",
    "PCA works by finding a set of orthogonal axes, called principal components, that capture the most variance in the data. \n",
    "The number of principal components is typically much smaller than the number of original features, \n",

    "\n",
    "PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of this dataset to 2 dimensions. \n",
    "To do this, we would first calculate the covariance matrix of the dataset. The covariance matrix is a square matrix \n",

    "\n",

    "The first principal component is the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue. \n",

    "\n",
    "The first principal component will capture the most variance in the data, and the second principal component will capture the \n",
    "second most variance. The remaining principal components will capture less variance, and can be discarded.\n",
