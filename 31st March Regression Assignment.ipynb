    "Traditional web hosting relies on dedicated physical servers with fixed resources and limited scalability. It is suitable for static workloads with predictable resource requirements. In contrast, cloud hosting leverages virtualized resources on a pay-as-you-go model, offering greater flexibility, scalability, and reliability. Cloud hosting is well-suited for dynamic workloads, applications with variable resource needs, and those requiring high availability and global reach."
