    "The intercept accounts for the baseline consumption that is not explained by the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Slope:\n",
    "The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit increase in the independent variable, \n",
    "holding other variables constant. It indicates the rate or magnitude of change in the dependent variable associated\n",
    "with a unit change in the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with the previous example, suppose the slope of the temperature variable is 2.5 units. \n",
