    "1. **Entropy and Information Gain**:\n",
    "   - **Entropy (H)**: Measure of impurity or disorder in a set. For a binary classification problem, it's given by:\n",
    "     \\[ H(S) = -p_1 \\log_2(p_1) - p_2 \\log_2(p_2) \\]\n",
    "     where \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\) are the probabilities of the two classes in the set \\( S \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Information Gain (IG)**: Quantifies the effectiveness of a feature in reducing entropy. The formula is:\n",
    "     \\[ IG(S, A) = H(S) - \\sum_{v \\in Values(A)} \\frac{|S_v|}{|S|} H(S_v) \\]\n",
    "     where \\( A \\) is a candidate feature, \\( Values(A) \\) are its possible values, \\( S_v \\) is the subset of \\( S \\) with value \\( v \\) for feature \\( A \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gini Impurity**:\n",
    "   - **Gini Impurity (Gini)**: Measures the frequency at which a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly classified. For a binary classification problem, it's given by:\n",
    "     \\[ Gini(S) = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i^2 \\]\n",

    "4. **Leaf Nodes and Predictions**:\n",
    "   - **Terminal Nodes (Leaves)**: Represent the final predicted class.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Decision Rules**: The path from the root to a leaf represents a decision rule based on feature values.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Reflecting Business Goals:**\n",
    "   - Different metrics emphasize different aspects of model performance. The choice should align with the business objectives. For example, in medical diagnosis, minimizing false negatives (increasing recall) might be crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Imbalanced Classes:**\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Cost Sensitivity:**\n",
    "   - Some misclassifications may have higher costs than others. Precision and recall consider false positives and false negatives differently, allowing the evaluation to reflect the associated costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trade-offs:**\n",
    "   - Precision-recall trade-off: Increasing one metric often leads to a decrease in another. Selecting the appropriate balance depends on the specific needs of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Choose an Appropriate Evaluation Metric:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the Problem:**\n",
    "   - Grasp the business context and the consequences of different types of errors. Consider whether false positives or false negatives are more critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Analyze the distribution of classes in the dataset. If imbalanced, consider metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define Success:**\n",
    "   - Clearly define what success looks like in the context of the problem. Is it more important to minimize false positives, false negatives, or achieve a balance?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Domain Knowledge:**\n",
    "   - Leverage domain expertise to identify relevant metrics. For instance, in fraud detection, minimizing false negatives might be more critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Utilize Multiple Metrics:**\n",
    "   - Consider using a combination of metrics to get a comprehensive view of model performance. For instance, a confusion matrix along with precision, recall, and F1 score provides a well-rounded assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Experiment and Validate:**\n",
