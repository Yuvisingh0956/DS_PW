        "\n",
        "For predicting house prices using an SVM regression model, several regression metrics can be employed to evaluate the model's performance. The choice of metric depends on the specific goals and requirements of the prediction task. Here are some commonly used regression metrics for evaluating the performance of a house price prediction model:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**\n",
        "   - **Interpretation:** Represents the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted house prices.\n",
        "   - **Advantage:** Provides a straightforward measure of the average prediction error.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**\n",
        "   - **Interpretation:** Represents the average squared difference between the actual and predicted house prices.\n",
        "   - **Advantage:** Penalizes larger errors more than MAE.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**\n",
        "   - **Interpretation:** Represents the square root of the average squared difference between the actual and predicted house prices.\n",
        "   - **Advantage:** Provides an interpretable measure in the same units as the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **R-squared (R2) Score:**\n",
        "   - **Interpretation:** Measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable explained by the model.\n",
        "   - **Advantage:** Indicates the goodness of fit of the model; a higher R2 score implies a better fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Median Absolute Error (MedAE):**\n",
        "   - **Interpretation:** Represents the median absolute difference between the actual and predicted house prices.\n",
        "   - **Advantage:** Less sensitive to outliers compared to MAE.\n",
        "\n",

        "## Q2. You have built an SVM regression model and are trying to decide between using MSE or R-squared as your evaluation metric. Which metric would be more appropriate if your goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible?\n",
        "\n",
        "To predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) would be more appropriate as the evaluation metric. Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "- In the context of predicting house prices, accurately estimating the magnitude of errors is crucial. MSE, by squaring the errors, heavily penalizes larger discrepancies between predicted and actual prices. This aligns with the goal of predicting house prices as accurately as possible, as it gives more weight to significant deviations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Additionally, the unit of MSE is squared units of the target variable (e.g., dollars squared in the case of house prices). This makes it directly interpretable in the same units as the target variable, providing a more intuitive understanding of the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "While R-squared is useful for assessing the overall goodness of fit, it may not be as sensitive to the precision of individual predictions as MSE is. Therefore, MSE is generally more appropriate when the goal is to minimize the magnitude of prediction errors in regression tasks such as house price prediction."

        "For a dataset with a significant number of outliers in SVM regression, the most appropriate metric is Median Absolute Error (MedAE).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Explanation:** MedAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE). It calculates the median of the absolute differences between the actual and predicted values, making it robust in the presence of outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Advantage:** Since outliers can disproportionately affect mean-based metrics, MedAE provides a more robust measure of central tendency. It's particularly useful when accurate predictions are crucial, and the impact of extreme values needs to be minimized."
