    "# Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you\n",
    "# might choose one over the other.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Label Encoding assigns a unique numeric label to each unique category in a categorical variable. \n",
    "It simply replaces the categories with integers starting from 0 or 1. \n",
    "The order of the labels is arbitrary and does not hold any particular meaning.\n",
    "Label Encoding is often used when the categorical variable is known to have no inherent order or hierarchy. \n",
    "It can be applied to variables like country names, colors, or product categories, where the numerical representation \n",
    "is arbitrary and the order does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding, on the other hand, assigns numerical labels to categories based on their order or rank. \n",
    "It preserves the ordinal relationship among the categories.\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding is suitable when the categorical variable has a clear ordering or hierarchy, \n",
    "such as education levels (e.g., elementary, high school, college) or income levels (e.g., low, medium, high). \n",
    "The numerical representation captures the relative differences between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's say you are working on a dataset of customer reviews for a product, and one of the features is the \n",
    "sentiment of the review (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). In this case, the sentiment is an unordered \n",
    "categorical variable, and there is no inherent ordering or hierarchy between positive, negative, or neutral. \n",
    "Therefore, Label Encoding would be appropriate to represent the sentiment categories as numeric labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, suppose you have a dataset with a feature representing academic degrees (e.g., bachelor's, master's, PhD). \n",
    "In this case, the degrees have a clear ordering, where a PhD is higher than a master's, which is higher than a bachelor's degree.\n",
    "Here, Ordinal Encoding would be suitable to represent the degrees, as it captures the relative ordering between the categories.\n",

    "1. Calculate the mean or median of the target variable for each category\n",

    "3. Assign ordinal labels to the categories\n",

    "\n",
    "You want to encode this categorical variable using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Basic: 0.25\n",
    "- Silver: 0.15\n",
    "- Gold: 0.10\n",
    "- Platinum: 0.05\n",

    "Next, you sort the categories in descending order based on the churn rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Platinum\n",
    "- Gold\n",
    "- Silver\n",
    "- Basic\n",

    "- Basic: 3\n",

    "By applying Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, you have encoded the subscription plan feature based on the relative\n",
