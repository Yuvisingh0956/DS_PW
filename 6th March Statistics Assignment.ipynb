    "\n",
    "2. Ordinal data: It is a level of measurement that allows you to rank data in order, but the difference between ranks is not necessarily equal. \n",
    "For example, a survey question that asks respondents to rate their satisfaction with a product on a scale of 1 to 5 has ordinal data. \n",
    "The difference between a rating of 1 and a rating of 2 is not necessarily the same as the difference between a rating of 4 and a rating of 5.\n",

    "3. Interval data: It is a level of measurement that allows you to rank data in order and the difference between ranks is equal. \n",
    "However, interval data does not have a true zero point. \n",
    "For example, temperature is measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. The difference between 10 degrees Celsius and 20 degrees Celsius is the \n",
    "same as the difference between 20 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees Celsius. However, there is no such thing as a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Ratio data: It is the highest level of measurement. It is similar to interval data, but it does have a true zero point. \n",
    "For example, weight is measured in kilograms or pounds. The difference between 10 kilograms and 20 kilograms is the same as the difference between 20 kilograms and 30 kilograms. \n",

    "1. Mean: The mean is the sum of all the values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It is often used to describe the central tendency of a dataset. \n",
    "The mean provides a good indication of the typical value of the data and is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order. \n",
    "It is another measure of central tendency that is often used when the data is skewed or contains outliers. The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. \n",
    "It is another measure of central tendency that is often used for categorical data or when looking for the most common value in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. \n",
    "It provides a measure of variability in the data, but it is highly sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) of a dataset. \n",
    "It provides a measure of variability that is less sensitive to outliers than the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the data around the mean. \n",
    "It provides a measure of variability that takes into account all of the values in the dataset. \n",
    "The standard deviation is sensitive to outliers and is often used to identify data points that are far from the mean.\n",

    "Each of these measures can be used to describe different aspects of a dataset. \n",
    "For example, the mean and median can be used to describe the central tendency of a dataset, while the range and IQR can be used to describe the variability in the data. \n",
